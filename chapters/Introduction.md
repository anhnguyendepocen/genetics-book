# Introduction {-}

There is nothing in the introduction yet. I have just put a few tests of Markdown for the text formatting workflow.

This is a test of citations: [@Hobolth:2011di]. [-@Hobolth:2011di]. @Hobolth:2011di.

Check [http://pandoc.org/demo/example19/Extension-citations.html](http://pandoc.org/demo/example19/Extension-citations.html) for documentation of the citation syntax. Use `chapters/bibliography.bib` for the bibliography---and don't put anything in the `chapters/References.md` file, it is only there to give the bibliography a chapter title.
