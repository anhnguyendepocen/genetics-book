>> Explanation of random drift and how we evolve as populations by random sampling each generation.

A common attack on evolutionary theory is that randomness doesn't bring complexity. If you have a hurricane going through a junk yard you won't end up with a plane. This is true. Randomness doesn't bring complexity. In the next chapter we will address why genetic theory does not build on randomness in that way. The theory we now have on evolution---we have had several in our history, but the one we have right now is the theory of natural selection---does not say that we evolve randomly. The *natural selection* part is important to understand evolution. But this chapter is not about natural selection. This chapter is on the randomness that underlies evolution.

When a mommy and daddy loves each other very much they make a baby. Lets look a little deeper into this. The stork doesn't bring the child, contrary to popular believes, but chemistry and biology happens.

When an egg is fertilised by a sperm this happens: you create a new being by merging two half-cells. The egg provides one set of chromosomes and the sperm provides the other. You get a set of chromosomes from your mother and another from your father. You get 23 in total, but you have two pairs of each. Well, if you are male, you have an X and a Y chromosome, these fellows work a little differently, but as a first approximation, just think of it as a mix of two sets of chromosomes that make you.

It is very likely that this combination of chromosomes never saw the light of day before. Even if you have siblings, they didn't get quite the same chromosomes from your parents. Each of your parents have two sets of those 23 chromosomes but they send them off to you in a random way. They don't pick just the right stuff to send along. It is, as far as we can tell, completely random winch version of their two copies they pass along.

Lets take chromosome one. It is the largest chromosome you have, which is why we call it number one, we order them according to length. Your father gives you one version; your mother gives you one copy. They both have two copies, but the one you get is a random choice between those two. That is how the biological mechanism works. You get random choices of the chromosomes. If you have three siblings, there is a 25% chance that you have your father's chromosome one and your mother's chromosome one. Your siblings have the same random chance, so if there are four of you, there are a good chance that you all have different chromosome ones.

But of course it isn't just chromosome one. You have 23 chromosomes that are a mix of your parents. If you happen to be male you will have received the Y chromosome from your father. That is how that works. That will be a copy of that one chromosome. If you are female you will have a copy of one of your mother's two X chromosomes and a copy of your father's one X chromosome. The sex chromosomes work a little differently; the rest of them you get a random sample of your parents two copies. You have two different copies of your genome; a probably unique combination that hasn't be around ever before.

Something that keeps surprising me, every time I think about it, is the scale of these chromosomes. They are pretty large. One copy of the human genome is about a meter long. There are three billion nucleotides in the human genome, and each takes up a third of a nanometer. That means they are really one meter long, in total. In each of your cells, excluding a few cells that do not actually have the full copy, but that is irrelevant for the amazing story, you have two meters of genetic material. My mind boggles at this. I find it hard to understand, but that apparently is the facts. And amazing facts it is.

Anyway, you have 23 chromosomes, and they get randomly shuffled each generation. That alone makes each child unique. Well, not quite, I must admit. Two to the power of 23 is only about eight millions, so we would see copies if that is all there is to it. It isn't, but that is how the math works. If you only had shuffling around of chromosomes, you would be one out of eight millions. You are much more unique than that, though, because we don't just shuffle around chromosomes.

The chromosomes you get from your parents aren't actually copies of their chromosomes. When your parents created sperm and egg cells they did something amazing. They created new chromosomes from their own two copies. We can't claim to really understand this mechanism, no one really does yet, it is a very active area of research, but we do know that you never get a complete copy of your parent's chromosomes. You get a mix of their chromosomes.

If you want to think about it this way, what you actually get is a mix of your grandparents chromosomes. Your mother and your father got copies---but mixed copies---of their parent's chromosomes. What they pass along to you is a mix of those.

Each chromosome that you receive is actually at mix of at least two chromosomes from your grand parents. The chemistry involved with making sperm and egg sells requires this. You never get a clean copy; you get a mixed copy. Longer chromosomes have more of these, and shorter have less, but they all recombine. That makes the eight million closer to sixteen billion. And that is a low estimate. You really are unique. The combination of chromosomes you have, is likely to have never been around before.

That isn't all, though. To the random shuffling of chromosomes, and the recombination of these, we have to add mutations.

Each generations you add mutations. Not the cool kind you see in X-men, but just the everyday variation. To those chromosomes you get from your parents, you add a few mutations. In your genes, you have about 150 new variants that never existed before.

That might sound like a big number. You have 150 mutations. But keep in mind that this is out of six billion nucleotides. If you wanted to read out the entire code of your genome it would take you a lifetime. If you read one a second and never sleep you would still take 80 years to read it all out. We are dealing with really large numbers here. We mutate a little, but the reproduction mechanism is really amazing.

Anyway, you have a unique combination of chromosomes and on top of that a unique set of mutations. This is the randomness of evolution. Each new person is a completely new combination of genetics.

Because of this random shuffling of chromosomes and the random mutations that is added on top of it, evolution never slows down. Each generation is different from the previous.

It is really hard to grown an intuition about how this whole thing works, but we do have maths to help us along, to guide our thoughts.
